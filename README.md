Personal information

•	Name: Lucas Randall Teo
•	Student number: s3536584
•	Emails: s3536584@student.rmit.edu.au - lucasrtsy@gmail.com

I am Singaporean, currently 23 years of age. I am in the midst of my bachelor’s degree. I am fluent in English. I lived in Singapore until I was 17 then went abroad to further my studies in an Australian boarding school. Since then, I found myself to be a creative thinker. 

Photography is an important hobby to me, as I like to capture the perfect moment. To the places I have travelled around the world, I keep these pictures with me to remind me of where I have been and it is to remind me of what I experienced in those places. Other than capturing moments, I spend time creating logos. Design is my go to pastime. I would just start up the illustrator app and just make up anything. Lastly, what I love is soccer. We try to find enough players for a game each week. 


## Interest in IT

 The world is constantly evolving. And i think we should follow the process of constant change and strive to improve in peoples’ everyday lives. Innovation peaks interest to individuals everyday with new cutting edge technology and beneficial to their lifestyle. 


•	When did your interest in IT start? 

In the last decade, the world felt so far apart. For example, to get a special product only sold in another country, you had to travel there or pay a large fee for shipping. Moreover, before the use of the Internet, the awareness of such products was very little. Nowadays, the brilliance of the Internet has brought the world closer together and consumers have a wider variety of products and services to utilize. What used to be only designated stores now have online websites to shop from. The world has now become smaller due to this. It solved people’s problems such as communicating with the jurisdiction of their country. Fascination about the internet intrigued me since I realized that information technology is essential for the world to work more easily together.

•	Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
  ➢	

•	Outline your IT experience (if any).

  ➢	

•	Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
  ➢	I went into Marketing at RMIT as it is one of the many forms of innovation to attract and spark awareness to a product that would benefit them. Information technology brings forward those ideas through research and understanding of the target market. We would be able to find the next innovative product or service that assists people to fix problems they encounter.


•	What do you expect to learn during your studies?
  ➢	Innovation is a personal goal. How to appeal to others needs is essential for my learning experience. I hope to learn the importance of research and development as well as future planning. The end game is to bring the world something new to the table. I would like to figure out a way to improve on their lifestyle. Once the problem is accessed, detailed research needs to be done, discussion with other partners of the team and then to execute once the decision is ready. 


## Ideal Job

My ideal job is to be a graphic designer. I can utilize my creative side to help clients with their wants and also to create technological advancements.

⦁	A graphic designer lets me use my creative side which I am very passionate in and will put in the effort to the best of my abilities.


⦁	I would need a background in design. Openness to creativity and innovation and patience. Each client might not like your initial proposals and you would have to revamp their portfolio according to their liking. That is the tedious part 

⦁	I have a small background in visual communication and design. I am majoring in marketing, which is a way to showcase my creativity. I have interned for Komoco Motors (car dealership) in Singapore and I got to use my creativity to create designs for their clubs and come up with incentives for marketing and how they need to keep up with advancements in technology


⦁	The plan after this course of marketing and IT, I would take a separate course on design. Either that or try to apply for internships at design or marketing firms to get an idea of how it would be like if I continue down this path.

 Who dares to speak and argue with points and not just sit there and be told what to do
 I will warn them about my disadvantages



# Project Idea 

Every designer faces many issues when it comes to creativity. Their design could have been done before or a similar one has been made. This leads to copyright claims and unoriginality. The main purpose of what we are trying to achieve is to let the designers’ lives easier and not have to worry about their work being stolen. The proposed project idea brings fourth a way for designers to patent their artwork on a platform before anyone else. Similar designs uploaded to the platform would be flagged and notified to the original designer. On this very same platform, we provide the integration of all designing tools, making it easier for the designer to make and showcase their artwork patent on our platform. Thus, attracting potential clients to get in business with the designers


Overview

Every designer faces many issues when it comes to creativity. Their design could have been done before or a similar one has been made. This leads to copyright claims and unoriginality. The main purpose of what we are trying to achieve is to let the designers’ lives easier and not have to worry about their work being stolen. The proposed project idea brings fourth a way for designers to patent their artwork on a platform before anyone else. Similar designs uploaded to the platform would be flagged and notified to the original designer. On this very same platform, we provide the integration of all designing tools, making it easier for the designer to make and showcase their artwork patent on our platform. Thus, attracting potential clients to get in business with the designers.



Motivation

The motivation that drives me to make this website is that many graphic designers have struggled with their datelines and also copyright issues. Therefore I have decided to make this platform where designing tools will be integrated which will allow graphic designers to finish their job at a quicker pace. The copyright issue could be solve by the use of the patent function in this platform, where users with similar designs could have a formal discussion about their designs and hopefully they will be able to come in terms with each other. This will avoid many copyright issues for graphic designers.


Description

The platform showcases different designers with their unique artwork. Each one will have a portfolio. We will use the software that has all the functions of a designing application so as to avoid the hassle of doing it somewhere else. They can then instantly patent their design before anyone else has a similar idea. However, our software scans the artwork for similarities before it is patented. If it is flagged as a similar design to another designer, a message will be sent to them and the first patented designer gets to decide on the approval of similarity. 

On the home page, random artwork from different designers will move horizontally and vertically throughout just in case one piece of art catches the viewer’s eye. There will be different tabs on the top of the page so the viewer can choose what they want to see. It is much like a filter. For example, when you open the filter tab, all boxes are ticked. If the viewer does not want to see black and white designs or paintings, they can simply remove the sub header and the page will be refreshed to their liking.

This platform is a sharing website where people are able to view various designers’ art and get fascinated. All these designers are for hire and if a potential client finds some user’s work intriguing, they can then click on their name. The name is a hyperlink that redirects the viewer to the designer’s main page. Over there, all the artwork of said designer is displayed. 

When there is a potential client, two things can happen. Firstly, the website will have an ”anti-screenshot” software which disallows the viewer to just steal the photo. The designer’s initials would also be on the design as to avoid plagiarism. Only if the client intends to buy the design and payment has been made via our website, you will then be able to download high-resolution file. Printing and delivery is also possible if need be. The next interest is that if the client wants a whole new design, they could get in contact via a email specified to our website as to instill privacy. The client would just have to send over a brief of what they are looking for and it is up for the designer to accept the job.

Also, with the designing platform on the website, an app must be created for users to upload their designs easily. This app will allow potential clients to view our users design on the app, as people tend to lean towards using their smart phones to view apps, this app will only allow users to upload their designs and for people to view the designs. The app will be restricted to these functions only, as it will not be possible for designers to do their designs on this app.
	
Hence to conclude, the main purpose of this platform is to ease the lives of graphic designers by providing an integration of all designing tools, allowing designers to finish their designs faster and also to showcase their designs. They will be able to patent their designs through this platform. This platform may attract potential clients and they will be able to contact the designers by viewing their profile.

Tools and Technologies

The tools and technology required for this program to work will be the following: image scanner, MIT App inventor, SQL database, a server tool for the website to run on and integration of all designing tools such as the functions of adobe illustrator and adobe Photoshop, more designing tools will be added to the website to aid our users. The image scanner will allow the website to scan for similar designs, and inform users if they have the same designs. The MIT App inventor will be use to create the add. The SQL data base will store information of all users and designs which will allow potential clients to look at the user's information including his/her designs. The database is a key part of this website as it stores all information of users and their designs. The designs will be patent upon submission on the website. The server tool will allow the website to stay online and keep it running.

TDMA – Time Division Multiple Access 
⦁	A digital transmission that grants multiple users to attain the same frequency
⦁	Divides each cellular channel into three time slots in order to increase data that can be carried
⦁	Enables some vital features for system operation in an advanced cellular or PCS environment
⦁	Relies upon the fact that the audio signal has been digitized into a number of milliseconds-long packets
⦁	Allocates a singular frequency channel for a short time and then moves to another channel
⦁	Advantages
⦁	Carry data rates of 64kbps to 120 Mbps
⦁	Provide user with extended battery life
⦁	Most affordable technology to convert an analogue system to digital
⦁	Separates users according to time to ensure zero interference
⦁	Allows fax, voice band data, and SMS 
⦁	Disadvantages
⦁	User have limited time slot. If all channels are full, user might be disconnected
⦁	Multipath distortion which may affect connect has it will bounce off several different buildings before arriving hence there will be lag

FDMA – Frequency division multiple access
⦁	Division of the frequency band allocated for all cellular phones to connect to the different channels
⦁	Each channel comprises of one user at a time
⦁	Analogue Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS)
⦁	Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service (D-AMPS) but adds time division (TDMA)
⦁	Allows more than one person to use the same radio frequency through giving active users a different frequency channel
⦁	FDMA assigns each call on a different frequency
⦁	There is a space in between the different used frequencies known as the guard band which is essential as to avoid frequency shifts (Doppler effect)

⦁	Advantages
⦁	If channel is not in use, it will be idle
⦁	Channel bandwidth is relatively narrow (30kHz)
⦁	Simple algorithm
⦁	Efficient when small in connectivity and traffic is constant
⦁	No restriction in regards of the type of baseband or type of modulation

⦁	Disadvantages
⦁	Presence of guard bands
⦁	Maximum bit rate per channel is fixed
⦁	Does not differ from analog system

CDMA – Code-division multiple access

⦁	No restriction on time and frequency
⦁	Parallel communication without colliding with others and whole bandwidth could be use
⦁	Users are separated by code not by time slot and frequency slot

⦁	Advantages
⦁	Potential larger capacity meaning more users can communicate at the same time
⦁	Easy addition of more users
⦁	High security as codes are hard to decipher
⦁	Stronger signals
⦁	Disadvantages
⦁	More users means overall service will decrease
⦁	Self jamming meaning that the signals may self jam and users will not be able to use the system

With the 3 options of wireless communication, I believe that using CDMA would be the ideal solution for my app. Reason is that it is easy to accommodate more users as well as the larger capacity of communication. CDMA’s codes are hard to decipher and this is important, as we need to protect the user’s privacy. Unfortunately, the higher the number of users means the decrease of service and jamming of the system. But the last two disadvantages mentioned can be rectified easily.

Skills Required

The skills required will be the coding of the SQL database which will include the information of the users and the designs the users have made. The database must also be integrated with the image scanner software so that the designs of different users do not clash with each other. There will be maintenance on the website and skills will be needed to handle this portion. The MIT app inventor will is an app that allows users to create their own apps with many guidelines. In this part, I believe that the skills that will be needed are people experiences from creating an app.  Lastly, the integration of all designing tools must be proper and precise, as the aim of this platform is for graphic designers hence in this part, the skills required will be the familiarization of all designing software and the tools that could aid graphic designers.

Outcome

Depending on its success, there would be a massive reduction in copyright claims and an increase in innovation to designers. Designers would no longer have to worry too much about other individuals stealing their ideas and their value, as a designer would stay as a unique entity. The development of this website establishes a safe environment for designers to present their work proudly. It would also hopefully attract more awareness of their name in the design industry based on the word-of-mouth and the clients they attract. Another possible outcome is collaboration of different designers to create whole new product theme of artwork.
