## Interest in IT

 Interest in IT

•	What is your interest in IT? 
   ➢	The world is constantly evolving. We should follow the process of constant change and strive to improve in peoples’ everyday lives. Innovation peaks interest to individuals everyday with new cutting edge technology and beneficial to their lifestyle. 


•	When did your interest in IT start? 
   ➢	In the last decade, the world felt so far apart. For example, to get a special product only sold in another country, you had to travel there or pay a large fee for shipping. Moreover, before the use of the Internet, the awareness of such products was very little. Nowadays, the brilliance of the Internet has brought the world closer together and consumers have a wider variety of products and services to utilize. What used to be only designated stores now have online websites to shop from. The world has now become smaller due to this. It solved people’s problems such as communicating with the jurisdiction of their country. Fascination about the internet intrigued me since I realized that information technology is essential for the world to work more easily together.

•	Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
  ➢	

•	Outline your IT experience (if any).

  ➢	

•	Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
  ➢	I went into Marketing at RMIT as it is one of the many forms of innovation to attract and spark awareness to a product that would benefit them. Information technology brings forward those ideas through research and understanding of the target market. We would be able to find the next innovative product or service that assists people to fix problems they encounter.


•	What do you expect to learn during your studies?
  ➢	Innovation is a personal goal. How to appeal to others needs is essential for my learning experience. I hope to learn the importance of research and development as well as future planning. The end game is to bring the world something new to the table. I would like to figure out a way to improve on their lifestyle. Once the problem is accessed, detailed research needs to be done, discussion with other partners of the team and then to execute once the decision is ready. 



## Ideal Job

Ideal Job

Find an advertisement showing what you believe to be your ideal job. This may require several years of experience, and hence be something that you must work towards, rather than something that you are ready for now, or will be able to fill as soon as you graduate.

There are various ways to search for IT jobs, including websites like {seek.com.au}. You should include the following information.


•	The job advertisement itself. Include a link, and a snapshot of it (in case the link expires before the assignment deadline).
o	https://www.seek.com.au/jobs-in-design-architecture?subclassification=6268%2C6266


•	A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.


•	A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.

•	A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.


•	A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.
