# My Profile



Personal information

•	Name: Lucas Randall Teo
•	Student number: s3536584
•	Emails: s3536584@student.rmit.edu.au - lucasrtsy@gmail.com

I am Singaporean, currently 23 years of age. I am in the midst of my bachelor’s degree. I am fluent in English. I lived in Singapore until I was 17 then went abroad to further my studies in an Australian boarding school. Since then, I found myself to be a creative thinker. 

Photography is an important hobby to me, as I like to capture the perfect moment. To the places I have travelled around the world, I keep these pictures with me to remind me of where I have been and it is to remind me of what I experienced in those places. Other than capturing moments, I spend time creating logos. Design is my go to pastime. I would just start up the illustrator app and just make up anything. Lastly, what I love is soccer. We try to find enough players for a game each week. 


## Interest in IT

 Interest in IT

•	What is your interest in IT? 
   ➢	The world is constantly evolving. We should follow the process of constant change and strive to improve in peoples’ everyday lives. Innovation peaks interest to individuals everyday with new cutting edge technology and beneficial to their lifestyle. 


•	When did your interest in IT start? 
   ➢	In the last decade, the world felt so far apart. For example, to get a special product only sold in another country, you had to travel there or pay a large fee for shipping. Moreover, before the use of the Internet, the awareness of such products was very little. Nowadays, the brilliance of the Internet has brought the world closer together and consumers have a wider variety of products and services to utilize. What used to be only designated stores now have online websites to shop from. The world has now become smaller due to this. It solved people’s problems such as communicating with the jurisdiction of their country. Fascination about the internet intrigued me since I realized that information technology is essential for the world to work more easily together.

•	Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
  ➢	

•	Outline your IT experience (if any).

  ➢	

•	Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
  ➢	I went into Marketing at RMIT as it is one of the many forms of innovation to attract and spark awareness to a product that would benefit them. Information technology brings forward those ideas through research and understanding of the target market. We would be able to find the next innovative product or service that assists people to fix problems they encounter.


•	What do you expect to learn during your studies?
  ➢	Innovation is a personal goal. How to appeal to others needs is essential for my learning experience. I hope to learn the importance of research and development as well as future planning. The end game is to bring the world something new to the table. I would like to figure out a way to improve on their lifestyle. Once the problem is accessed, detailed research needs to be done, discussion with other partners of the team and then to execute once the decision is ready. 



## Ideal Job

Ideal Job

Find an advertisement showing what you believe to be your ideal job. This may require several years of experience, and hence be something that you must work towards, rather than something that you are ready for now, or will be able to fill as soon as you graduate.

There are various ways to search for IT jobs, including websites like {seek.com.au}. You should include the following information.

Overview

People get into long-distance relationships all around the world. But what if the fluent Chinese person is unable to communicate to the fluent English partner. A brand new relationship of communicating over different countries can be a hassle. Eventually, the partnership would not flourish but instead lose its edge. The proposed project would be to create a texting app that translates one person’s language into the others. This app does not have to just be for people looking for relationships, but it can also be used for business purposes. In a way, it breaks the language barrier. Hence, the world can be more connected.


People are already friends around the world. What if we could make that easier? The project is based on creating an app that brings people together with similar interests or people that want to be in business together. People with similar traits can be brought together for business or partnerships. Different forums for different situations entices individuals to join and bond or talk about business. The groups give us a way of connecting more people together, solving the problem of having to look for individuals with the same interests.


Motivation

Forbes insights inform us that 67% of miscommunications lead to inefficiency. Moreover, with this app, people would be more willing to communicate to people around the world. Removal of the language barrier is interesting as then there would be fewer problems. A small miscommunication between overseas businesses or saying something wrong to the person they are talking to could ruin the relationship or given the wrong instruction


Description

The app will work like a normal texting app like Telegram or Whatsapp. However, the message the person types will be translated before it reaches the recipient. So for example, if the person types in English, there will be a translate button. Once it is translated to the preferred language, the user can then send the message and vice-versa. 

With this app, it omits the need to use Google translate or any other translator. The app will do it for you. The app can also translate to three or more different languages at a time in case there is groups chat with three or more languages involved. Since some country’s languages has different dialects, traditional and modern languages we will provide an option for those as well. Settings will be available for themes such as colour and font style for the writing. 

The app also can connect to your mac or PC. The account will be totally secure. There will be a terms and conditions agreement before the app can be used. Emojis are universal; hence those would be in the app as well. Notifications will be set. For businesses involved, there will also be a function where if you send a document, the app will scan it and translate it to its best capabilities. A forum page will also be set up to discuss any questions from around the world. This would be the open concept, a tab in the app where there will be topics as headers. Once again, the translate button would be there and everyone can read it. This enables open discussions for people around the world.


Tools and Technologies

Firstly, we need a translator to build and make sure the translations are right. Next is to build the app. Creating the design and layout for it. We need a budget to pay for the initial building of the app. We need investors that believe the app will be useful and functional. 

Skills Required

An IT expert is needed to set up the initial website and build the software. We would need to do trials on the translations, as some language change may not be as accurate. We could incorporate certain phrases that directly translate to a phrase of a different language.

Outcome 

If everything goes to plan, the world would be able to be confident enough to speak to one another through our app. The impact will help us bridge the global gap, as if everyone is speaking one language. More business deals can be done and collaboration could lead to more innovative ideas and possibly the creation of more companies with other ideas to be inspired. More relationships can be bloom and the networking of the world would be a way much easier place.
